   - ADDED SMTP Server location and login credentials


0.5 (rev. 168) - 18 May 2010
-----------------------------
  - ADDED: percentage of allocated task time to the report
  - FIXED: too much output produced by a build task (make/execute/svn) caused this task to block forever
           on subprocess.wait() or to crop the output
  - FIXED: incorrect elapsed build time reported when the build has been forcibly rerminated because of timeout
  - FIXED: baseDirectory => workingDirectory in "exec" element
  - FIXED: added current directory to the search path when launching executable

  - Added configuration flag controlling whether the ccpy should skip building/execution
    of the source code which has not been changed since the last checkout
  - Added configuration flag controlling whether the ccpy should stop execution of the rest of project
    tasks of the project and set project status to FAILED once one of the tasks fails
  - Kill any child processes spawned by make or exec tasks on forced exit because of timeout
